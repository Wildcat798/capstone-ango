# This project creates a two tiered web site template for a non governmental organization (i.e., Asia NGO or ANGO) of legal professionals.

## The first tier is a public page providing the public with general information about the legal focused ANGO.

## The second tier is a members only section providing information to members not published to the public at large.  This tier includes a two way chat feature for members to communicate with each other via

### general chat room
### private one-on-one chat
### special interests (lawmakers, judges, lawyers, professors, students)
